\section{Acknowledgements}
The content of this thesis reflects the work of a wide group of physicists collaborating on an analysis project and sharing their knowledge.  I received much guidance from Vuko Briglevi\'{c} and Tulika Bose while enjoying camaraderie in the trenches with Cory Fantasia, Sre\'{c}ko Morovi\'{c}, and Irakli Svintradze as they applied their ingenuity to make our measurements work.

My efforts have been greatly aided by the encouragement of my officemates Mike Anderson and Will Maier.  They stretched my concept of what computers can do and pushed me to tackle bolder problems than I would have attempted on my own.

Matt Herndon, serving as my graduate advisor, gave me the freedom to explore what inspired me while providing the support to understand complex details of our measurements and their significance.  In particular, this document is much stronger due to his careful reading and deeply thoughtful comments.

My family has been extremely supportive throughout my graduate work, including foremost my wife, Karen, and my parents, Arnie and Carol.
