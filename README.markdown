# Introduction

This is the source of my UW-Madison Ph.D. thesis, which I hope can help make you aware of some hurdles I encountered in organizing a large LaTeX project and implementing all of the features I wanted.  All the basic setup as established by the university comes from [uwthesis.sty](https://github.com/jklukas/uwthesis) which I keep in a separate repository.  I use some other bells and whistles which I try to document in the following sections.  You might want to read those before browsing the code.

For my own sanity, I want to document how to pull in the `uwthesis` content as a git submodule:

    git clone git@github.com:jklukas/gradthesis.git
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
