\setabstract{%
A search for exotic particles decaying via $WZ$ to final states with electrons and muons is performed using a data sample of $pp$ collisions collected at \SI{7}{\TeV} center-of-mass energy by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \jsonlumi.  A cross section measurement for the production of $WZ$ is also performed on a subset of the collision data.  No significant excess is observed over the Standard Model background, so lower bounds at the 95\% confidence level are set on the production cross sections of hypothetical particles decaying to $WZ$ in several theoretical scenarios.  Assuming the Sequential Standard Model, \wprime{} bosons with masses below \wprimelimit{} are excluded.  New limits are also set for several configurations of Low-Scale Technicolor.
